Feature vector for classification:

UPDATE INDEXES!!!!

Some features are metadata for tracking, shouldn't really be used for classification 

Commit features:

	commit id (assigned in order, use in case we have to match stuff up later)
0	user id (integer)
1	repository name (string)
3	time of commit (UTC timestamp)
	number of packages added by user in this commit
	number of packages updated between user's last commit and this one (for this specific repo)
	number of packages added by user and updated recently (intersection of two above sets)

Event-specific metadata:

2	library/package name (string)
4	user added? (binary, 1/T if user committed this package at this time, 0/F otherwise-skipped adoption opportunity)

User-specific features:

4	number of packages committed
5	number of packages implicitly seen
6	number of packages adopted
7	time since last commit
8	time since last adoption
9	intra-commit duration for last 10% of user's commits
10	number of repos commited to
11	number of repos commited to in last 10% of user's commits
12	percentage of commits with adoptions
13	percentage of commits with library imports
14	percentage of adoption commits in last 10% of user's commits
15	percentage of library import commits in last 10% of user's commits

User/Package features:

16	user adopted package? (binary)
17	user already used this package (binary)
18	number of times user has implicitly seen package
	total number of times user seen all packages
20	number of times user seen package / total number of times user seen all packages
19	number of times user has implicitly seen package within last 10% of user's commits
	total number of times user seen all packages in last 10%
21	number of times user seen package in last 10% of user's commits / total number of times user seen all packages in last 10%

Package features from GitHub history:

22	number of commits adding this package
23	number of users who have committed this package
24	number of users who have adopted this package (number of package adoptions)
25	number of repos containing this package
26	number of repos this package was adopted in
27	time since last adoption (in seconds)
28	time since last commit (in seconds)
29	average time between package adoptions in last 10% of adoptions
30	average time between commits within last 10% of commits of this package
31	time between commits of this package within last 10% of ALL commits
32	time between adoptions of this package within last 10% of ALL commits
		
Package features from StackOverflow:

33	total number of posts containing this package
34	total views of all posts containing package
35	number of recent posts containing package (last 30 days)
36	total views of recent posts (last 30 days)

Labels are 0/1, assigned based on intra-repo adoption criteria

To extract adoption labels where any first usage is an adoption:
	user used package must be false
	user added package must be true
if both of those are true, user used package for the first time in that commit - global adoption
should be more of those than the repo-centric adoption criteria
